# Team-RentSure

## ðŸš€ Overview
RentSure is an open-source rental management platform for arbiters, landlords, and renters, which employs blockchain technology towards streamlining rentals. It addresses the underlying trust issue in rental agreements with the use of escrow-based smart contracts, token-gated document read-only, and credit scoring on chain.

Traditional rental systems are marred with delayed payments, unverifiable histories, and dispute resolution with no neutral mechanism. RentSure presents a trustless, transparent, and tamper-proof solution that builds accountability, accelerates agreements, and safeguards all stakeholders

## ðŸŒŸ Core Features of RentSure
- âœ… Agreement Automation
Digitally signed rental agreements between Tenant and Landlord

Stored securely via IPFS or on-chain references

Immutable and time-stamped to prevent tampering

- âœ… Escrow-Based Deposits
Tenant deposits funds into a smart contract escrow

Funds are only released upon mutual confirmation of move-in by both parties

Reduces fraud and builds trust without intermediaries

- âœ… Conditional Payment Logic
Enables milestone-based payouts (e.g., deposit â†’ move-in â†’ rent cycles)

Prevents unilateral withdrawals or missed payments

- âœ… Dispute Resolution via Arbiter
Neutral third-party arbiter role

Can vote or intervene in case of conflicts

Integrated with decentralized voting or off-chain arbitration services

- âœ… Reputation System (Soulbound Tokens)
Tenants and landlords earn non-transferable SBTs based on behavior

Includes metrics like successful agreements, timely payments, and dispute frequency

SBTs act as a decentralized credit score

- âœ… Token-Gated Document Access
Sensitive documents (leases, receipts, ID verifications) accessible only to authorized wallet holders

Prevents unauthorized access and leaks

- âœ… Web3 Identity Integration
Uses wallet addresses (e.g., MetaMask) for login and identity

No need for centralized user credentials

- âœ… Audit-Friendly Transparency
All contract interactions are recorded on-chain

Facilitates clean audit trails for legal or compliance needs
